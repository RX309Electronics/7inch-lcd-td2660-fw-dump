# 7inch-lcd-td2660-fw-dump

In this repo i have put the binary file i dumped from the onboard flash of a cheap 7inch display (a winbond 25x40lc) using a ch341a flash/eeprom reader/programmer. 
Please note i am not responsible for any damage done when (re)programming the flash on your lcd display and i wont guarantee this will work on other display boards using the rtd2660. my display board was from aliexpress and i use it for my raspberry pi nd decided it might be fun to dump the firmware. The display on mine uses a TTL (transistor transistor logic) compatible flex ribbon cable to connect to the board where the rtd2660 is.
